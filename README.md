# IDS-575-Airbnb-Price-Prediction

# 1 Abstract

Nowadays, the number of people involved in staycation as a guest or host are rising. This situation produces availability in an alternative way that allows tourists to customize their rent plan and gain their experience. However, the accommodation price would become more competitive day by day due to high demand, especially in a big city like New York. This research performed with the purpose of acquiring the fittest model and competitive price for airbnb’s. The results emphasize the score of each room type (apt room/hotel room/shared room/private room). This research focuses on the linear model and other related models to determine how the price relates to any other factor. The correlation between Airbnb price and the room’s type showed how diverse the price for areas combined. The location of Airbnb is also a major factor of the price competitiveness compared to others. To make an analysis out of our datasets, we did exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) which was performed using matplotlib, pandas, and seaborn packages. After undergoing the data analysis on the datasets, we executed a linear regression model, SVR, gradient boost, etc to determine which model suits our objectives. Finally,  we evaluate the model using evaluation metric Root Mean Square(RMSE) and Median absolute Error (MAE) since it is less sensitive to outliers compared to other metrics.  The graph shows that most of the models are able to predict the price with a median error around 20 to 30 dollars.
